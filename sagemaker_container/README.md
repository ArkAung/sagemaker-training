Code to train a simple DCGAN. Feel free to structure this the way you like to cater to your requirements. 

A Docker image will be created by copying all the python scripts in this directory to `/opt/ml/code`. Python packages which will be installed in the Docker image are listed in `requirements.txt`.

* `main.py` is the main entry script which will be run when the SageMaker training job starts.
